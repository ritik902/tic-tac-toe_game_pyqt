# tic-tac-toe_game_pyqt
This is my Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using the PyQt framework. I implemented both the backend and frontend logic in Python. The game can currently be played locally after installing the application. Additionally, I have packaged it as a Debian (.deb) package, making it easy to install on any Debian-based system.
